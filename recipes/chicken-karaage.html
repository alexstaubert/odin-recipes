    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>10g fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>20g soy sauce</li>
        <li>5g sesame oil</li>
        <li>20g mirin</li>
        <li>20g sake or white wine</li>
        <li>8g salt</li>
        <li>30g cornstarch</li>
        <li>3g MSG</li>
        <li>200g Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
        <li>10g seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>5g togarashi (Japanese chili powder)</li>
        <li>High smokepoint oil for frying (canola, avocado, light olive)</li>
        <li>Shredded cabbage, for serving</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Chicken by cutting thighs into 4 equal pieces each, about 1.5” (3-4cm) across. Place in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Marinate: Grate the ginger and garlic directly into the bowl with the chicken. Add soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin, sake or white wine, salt, cornstarch, and MSG if using. Mix until well combined and the chicken is evenly coated. The mixture should look slightly pasty. Refrigerate to marinate for at least 30 minutes, but not more than 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Prepare Spicy Mayo: In another bowl, combine Kewpie mayonnaise, seasoned rice vinegar, togarashi, and chili oil. Stir until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cabbage: Finely shred enough cabbage for serving and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a heavy-bottomed pot halfway with canola oil and heat to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>To dredge the Chicken, place the potato starch in a bowl. Spritz with 20-30 sprays of water to moisten and mix to incorporate. Add half of the marinated chicken pieces and toss to coat thoroughly, pressing additional starch into each piece to ensure the starch forms craggy bits on the chicken. Gently shake off excessive starch.</li>
        <li>To fry, use a spider or slotted spoon, carefully lower the coated chicken into the hot oil. Fry in batches, without crowding the pot, for about 2.5 minutes until lightly golden. Remove and let drain on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the oil for a second fry, this time for 60-90 seconds until medium brown. Drain and rest for 1 minute, then fry for a final 60-90 seconds until very crispy and darker golden brown.</li>
        <li>Arrange the fried chicken on a platter with finely shredded cabbage, spicy mayonnaise, and a lemon wedge. Serve with cold beverages for a complete party experience.</li>     
    </ol>
