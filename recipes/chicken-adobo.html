    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This is a recipe for a simple but amazing chicken dish from the Philippines, I think. This iteration by Joshua Weissman is my favourite. Eat with rice!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>20 garlic cloves, heavily crushed</li>
        <li>Crack of black pepper</li>
        <li>300mL unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>120mL soy sauce (preferably Silver Swan)</li>
        <li>60mL dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>7g black peppercorns</li>
        <li>50g palm sugar</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>120mL water</li>
        <li>Green onions for topping</li>
        <li>Rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add in all the chicken (thighs and drumsticks) and the heavily crushed cloves of garlic. </li>
        <li>To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, black peppercorns, palm sugar, unseasoned rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, filtered water, and toss together and add in bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or ideally overnight. **Reserve all marinated liquid**</li>
        <li>Set a large braiser or dutch oven over medium-high heat and coat with oil to cover the pan.</li>
        <li>Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side. Place each batch to the side once done browning to avoid overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along with all the aromatics. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces to the pan in layers and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer (covered) for 35 minutes. Uncover and flip the chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook for another 25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to thoroughly coat and the sauce thickens and a glaze.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken on a plate of rice topped with green onions. Spoon on as much sauce as desired.</li>  
    </ol>
